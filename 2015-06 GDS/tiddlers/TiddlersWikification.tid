!! ''Tiddly'' === Everything is a tiddler

A tiddler is defined as the smallest semantic unit of information.

//It is a structure optimised for reuse through aggregation and composition.//

!! ''Wiki'' === Everything is wikification


Wikification is the process of converting ~WikiText into HTML.

//It makes linking (and other hypertext operations) become part of the punctuation of writing.//
