[img width="75%" [SingleFilePattern.png]]

~TiddlyWiki is a universal ~JavaScript wiki that can run entirely in the browser, or under Node.js. Internally, it is a pipeline for efficiently parsing and rendering a dialect of wikitext that is rich enough to express the entire user interface.

It's also a Quine.
